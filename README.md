# "LeaveMeAlone" Browser Extension

"Leave Me Alone" is a lightweight browser extension that will alert you if you are entering a website marked as potentially malicious by the [Cyber Threat Coalition](https://www.cyberthreatcoalition.org/). The extension will not do anything at all if you never visit a website on the list, and will simply warn you to stay away if you happen to enter one of these websites.

In fact, the best case scenario is that you download this extension and never hear from it again. However, it is there, never bothering you, never creating any problems, ready to help that one time you really need it. Because one mistake is enough: if you share your data with just one malicious website, that could cause you headaches for a lifetime. Stay safe and happy browsing!
